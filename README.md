## About
The Slider tool is a great way to view imagery from various weather satellites, however the UI is difficult to use when viewing on a mobile device. This app lets you change some of the tool's settings using a native UI for a better experience. 


## Running the app
1. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio on Windows or Mac (must have Xamarin installed)
2. Set the Android or iOS project as start up
   1. For iOS, change the iOS Bundle Settings to your information 
3. Build and deploy the project
